# transcription
An Embedded Systems Project by Bhavya, Jay, Maitrey, Parth.

1. This Project aims to performes a real time speech transcription in form of hard copies.

2. The working is such that the recognized speech is automatically sent via bluetooth of the device connected to the HC-05
   which is further connected to the microprocessor. The microprocessor performs the transcription mechanism through 
   connected motors. 

3. The C code is dumped on the respective microprocessor (AVR, for our case) and the speech recognition is done via a parallel running
   Python script.
